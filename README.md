## Description :
It is the color test by psychologist Max Lüscher (1923-2017), in an ultra-simplified version.
The color test is used to assess a person's emotional state at a given time, based on their color preference at the time.
This test is little known but is of good clinical interest, it is relevant and quite "powerful".
It is a test that relies on the relationship between the perception of wavelengths of colors, and emotions. It is very scientific.
It is not for nothing that some expressions exist in the French language like: "See the world in gray" ; or: "Voir la vie en rose"...

## Taking the test :
Eight colors are presented at the same time to the person taking the test.
The colors are: blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black and gray.
The subject chooses the colors one by one, according to his order of preference of the moment (and this is very important, see below the precautions for handing over).

The subject must not associate the color with an object that he likes, for example, otherwise it distorts the test. Or, if his favorite color is blue, he shouldn't take it into account.
The instructions for the book state:
> "ESPECIALLY do not try to associate this color with something else, with a dress fabric, with an interior, with a car or any other object. Simply choose the color which attracts you the more among the eight colors you have in front of you. "


The classification will allow a projection of certain components of the psychosomatic personality of the subject, at the time when he took the test.

## History of my personal interest in this program
> I discovered the color test in the early 2000s, after having come across an Internet application by chance.
I used the application several times on my own and I was very surprised by the extraordinary relevance of the results. I also passed it on to other people, and it convinced me of the strength of the test and its validity.
Having psychological difficulties at the time, I was very interested in taking the test every day for a given period. The only problem is that the program I had recovered (TESTCOUL.EXE) did not allow to record the history of the transfers, and thus to create an analyzable database. Being trained in programming from my first studies, I therefore decided to create a program using Microsoft Access software that allowed it. I advanced well in this program, and I had a functional graphical interface which made it possible to make the choice of colors.
But I did not have the exact sentences which are given in analysis results, a very precise sentence established by Max Lüscher, and I therefore tried to find a work on the subject.
I found in the Nanterre library a copy of the book which would allow me to know more, and I photocopied some of the parts which seemed to me the most essential, but I had other things to do and I put the program on standby.
Some time later, in March 2008, when I was a psychology student at the University of Paris Descartes, I noticed in the catalog that there was another work on the test of colors, more recent than the one that I had photocopied in Nanterre. But the book was in the library of the University of Toulouse. Fortunately, there is a loan service between libraries (PEB) which allowed me to order the work and consult it in Paris. Again, I photocopied the book, because I couldn't keep it for as long as I wanted.

## Warning :
Only a psychologist can provide a reliable analysis of your mental and emotional health. Every psychological test requires human validation, and its result can be legitimized by people close to you, who have coexistence and knowledge of your personality.

## History of this program :
- The recovery of the Russian program was made in April 2013 on Github. A first translation has been made, and the JS program has been improved, but I lost the file by mistake some time later.
- In March 2020, a new and improved version is put online. This version benefits from the following improvements:
  - Update of the JS code, based on JQuery (from version 1.7.1 to version 3.4.1)
  - Texts translated into french
  - Better documented code, added some debugging messages in the console that can be turned ON/OFF
  - Improved documentation in Markdown format, in french and english.

## Still To-do
- Add a random color positioning system

## Other interesting programs.
  - Several programs have been developed for the mobile phone (under Android)

## Files :

  - `luscher_test_russian.html` : the original version of the program
  - `lusher.html` : the new version, in french, using bootstrap and jQuery
  - `assets/css/styles.css` : the stylesheet
  - `LISEZMOI.md` : complete documentation in french language (Markdown format)
  - `README.md` : documentation in english (Markdown format)

### Marketing :
His research has confirmed that using the right color on packaging can have a hypnotic effect on the buyer. Likewise the coloring of objects can influence their commercial success (for example the Volkswagen Beetle should give him a share of his success).

## The Lüscher test
The Lüscher test exists in several forms:
- the complete test using a large color chart, available only in German,
- the simplified test using color cubes.
The program corresponds to this test, but it delivers few results and only offers a very simplified analysis.

### A powerful and fast-to-perform tool
Among the deep tests in Psychology, the Lüscher Color Test is the fastest to perform and, despite its simplicity of application, it is a powerful tool for revealing physical and psychological stress sources, anxieties, repressed personality traits and so much more.

### Interpretation of the test :
It is complex and documented on the [official website : Lüscher Color Diagnostik]

According to the [Auriol website présenting their usage of the test](http://cabinet.auriol.free.fr/psychologie/luscher.htm), a simple interpretation of this test consists in looking if a color is classified among the favorites (the first four) or the least liked (the last four).
> This test is little known but is of some clinical interest. It (Zirilli G., 1967), is widely used by certain specialists in personnel recruitment.

### Nota :
Test results may vary depending on age.
(a color quotient was created by firm Auriol which makes it possible to evaluate a kind of emotional age via the Lüscher test).
People who have energy, creativity, success would have this test at a very young age compared to their real age..
