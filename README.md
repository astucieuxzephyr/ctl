# Description :

It is the color test by psychologist Max Lüscher (1923-2017), in an ultra-simplified version.
The color test is used to assess a person's emotional state at a given time, based on their color preference at the time.
This test is little known but is of good clinical interest, it is relevant and quite "powerful".
It is a test that relies on the relationship between the perception of wavelengths of colors, and emotions. He is very scientific.
It is not for nothing that expressions exist in the French language such as: "See the world in gray". Or: "See life in color"...

# Principle of the test :
Eight colors are presented to the subject taking the test.
The colors are: blue, green, red, yellow, purple, brown, black and gray.

The subject chooses the colors one by one, according to their order of preference of the moment (and this is very important).
The classification will allow a projection of certain components of the psychosomatic personality of the subject, at the time when he took the test.


# Personal interest, and history of this program :
- I discovered the color test a long time ago, after finding an application on the Internet.
   I used the application several times and I was surprised by the relevance of the results.

- The recovery of the Russian program was made in April 2013 on Github
 A first translation was made, and the JS program improved, but the file was lost.

- In March 2020, a new and improved version is put online.
   This version benefits from the following improvements:
- Update of JQuery (from the)
- Better documented code
- Texts in French made from Google Translator
- Texts revised with Max Lüsher's book
- Improved documentation in Markdown format.

- TODO: A random color positioning system is planned.

# Other interesting programs.
  - Several programs have been developed for the mobile phone (under Android)

## About Max Lüscher (from Wikipedia source)

Max Lüscher is a Swiss psychologist and philosopher, professor of psychology.
He is considered the father of color psychology.

### Marketing
His research has confirmed that using the right color on packaging can have a hypnotic effect on the buyer. Likewise the coloring of objects can influence their commercial success (for example the Volkswagen Beetle should give him a share of his success).

### The Lüscher test
The Lüscher test exists in several forms:
- complete test using a large color chart, available only in German,
- simplified test using color cubes.

### Interpretation of the test :
It is complex and documented on the [official website : Lüscher Color Diagnostik]

According to the firm Auriol, a simple interpretation of this test consists in looking if a color is classified among the favorites (the first four) or the least liked (the last four).
This test is little known but is of some clinical interest. It (Zirilli G., 1967), is widely used by certain specialists in personnel recruitment.

### Nota :
Test results may vary depending on age.
(a color quotient was created by firm Auriol which makes it possible to evaluate a kind of emotional age via the Lüscher test).
People who have energy, creativity, success would have this test at a very young age compared to their real age..
